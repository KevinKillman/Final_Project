The goal of this project was to determine if there was a tangible relationship between a sentiment analysis of Twitter and stock pricing. Multiple machine learning algorithms were used to examine this relationship. Unfortunately, only a weak correlation was found with the data used, not enough to make any reasonable predictions off of.

I am continuing to build up the stock dashboard to include different kinds of charts, specifically candlesticks and OHLC. 

I plan to expand the machine learning part of the project in the future. I hope to be able to really dig into the features I am giving the algorithms to see if I can create some accurate predictions.
